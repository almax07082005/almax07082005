# Hi there, I'm **Maksim Al Dandan!** 👋😊

## 🚀 **About Me**

Being passionate about backend development and scalable architectures, I thrive in designing robust, high-performance solutions that drive business efficiency 🚀.

At IT-One, I played a key role in a major banking project, taking full ownership of a core business feature for an upcoming release. This feature streamlines client operations, reducing manual effort and increasing overall efficiency. I have also worked on backend architecture improvements, ensuring the system can scale effectively as business demands grow. Tackling critical and high-impact issues, I have helped make the system more reliable and fault-tolerant, while refining the codebase with modern Java and Spring best practices to enhance development quality.

Beyond corporate development, I have taken ideas from concept to fully functional products. The Cardio Telegram Bot ❤️ was a full-cycle project where I designed, developed, and launched a fully operational system serving 800+ users. With a strong focus on automation and scalability, I integrated a CI/CD pipeline, making deployments faster and more efficient.

In the Restaurant Website project 🍴, I led a team of five developers, coordinating frontend and backend efforts while establishing an efficient Git workflow. This experience strengthened my teamwork, leadership, and mentoring skills, proving that successful projects are built through collaboration and technical excellence 👥🔥.

I’m always open to new challenges, exciting projects, and meaningful connections. Let’s build something amazing together! 😊💡🎯
